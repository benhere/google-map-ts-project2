# In this project, we will build simple web application where we can enter an address then we will convert that address into a pair of coordinates and we will do this with the help of Google's Map API. Then we will render these coordinates on a map that will be render with the help of Google's Map JS SDK.

# We will use two third-party libraries here and these are 1). HTTP sending library, 2). Google Map library.
